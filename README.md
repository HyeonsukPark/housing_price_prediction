# Lisbon Housing Price Prediction Dashboard 

This project presents a machine learning dashboard designed to predict housing prices in the Lisbon area. 
It leverages several models, with the Random Forest model demonstrating the highest accuracy.

## Machine Learning Project  

The project began with an in-depth analysis of a comprehensive housing dataset for Portugal. To provide more precise predictions, the focus was narrowed to residential properties exclusively within the Lisbon district.

We evaluated three machine learning models for this task: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. 
After training and validation, the Random Forest model emerged as the most effective, achieving an impressive
R2 score of 0.8696.

For comparison, the performance of the other models was as follows:  

* Linear Regression: R2 Score 0.7696  
* Decision Tree: R2 Score 0.7767
* Random Forest: R2 Score 0.8696  

## Streamlit Dashboard  

The Streamlit dashboard allows users to interactively predict housing prices based on their specific criteria. 
Users can input key features such as location, property type, size, and other relevant details. 
The dashboard then uses the pre-trained Random Forest model to generate an accurate price prediction, 
providing a valuable tool for anyone interested in the Lisbon real estate market.
